# Healer Only Mana

This **extremely** lightweight addon was created for people to quickly and easily see any healer's mana on the raid frame without needing to see everyone's powerbar.

By default, all immunity and damage reduction abilities have been added.

**Notes:**
- Only Blizzard frames are currently supported.
- No in-game options.
- Does not taint.
